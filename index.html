				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
										Ten years ago the authors undertook to produce a book covering the known material on
							formal languages, automata theory, and computational complexity. In retrospect, only a
							few significant results were overlooked in the 237 pages. In writing a new book on the
							subject, we find the field has expanded in so many new directions that a uniform comprehensive
							coverage is impossible. Rather than attempt to be encyclopedic, we have been
							brutal in our editing of the material, selecting only topics central to the theoretical
							development of the field or with importance to engineering applications.
							Over the past 10 years two directions of research have been of paramount importance.
							First has been the use of language-theory concepts, such as nondeterminism and the
							complexity hierarchies, to prove lower bounds on the inherent complexity of certain
							practical problems. Second has been the application of language-theory ideas, such as
							regular expressions and context-free grammars, in the design of software, such as compilers
							and text processors. Both of these developments have helped shape the organization
							of this book.
							Both authors have used Chapters 1 through 8 for a senior-level cout/se, omitting only
							the material on inherent ambiguity in Chapter 4 and portions of Chapter 8. Chapters 7,
							8, 12, and 13 form the nucleus of a course on computational complexity. An advanced
							course on language theory could be built around Chapters 2 through 7, 9 through II,
							and 14.
